## 2. Persistent Personas? Role-Playing, Instruction Following, and Safety in Extended Interactions

**Authors:** Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Michael A. Hedderich, Ali Modarressi, Hinrich Schuetze, Benjamin Roth

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-14

**Summary:** Persona-assigned large language models (LLMs) are used in domains such as education, healthcare, and sociodemographic simulation. Yet, they are typically evaluated only in short, single-round settings that do not reflect real-world usage. We introduce an evaluation protocol that combines long person...

## 3. Decoding Student Minds: Leveraging Conversational Agents for Psychological and Learning Analysis

**Authors:** Nour El Houda Ben Chaabene, Hamza Hammami, Laid Kahloul

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-11

**Summary:** This paper presents a psychologically-aware conversational agent designed to enhance both learning performance and emotional well-being in educational settings. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LS...

## 4. Examining Student Interactions with a Pedagogical AI-Assistant for Essay Writing and their Impact on Students Writing Quality

**Authors:** Wicaksono Febriantoro, Qi Zhou, Wannapon Suraworachet, Sahan Bulathwela, Andrea Gauthier et al. (7 authors)

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-09

**Summary:** The dynamic nature of interactions between students and GenAI, as well as their relationship to writing quality, remains underexplored. While most research has examined how general-purpose GenAI can support writing, fewer studies have investigated how students interact with pedagogically designed sy...

## 5. Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Entity Linking for Educational Platforms

**Authors:** Francesco Granata, Francesco Poggi, Misael Mongiovì

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-05

**Summary:** In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources. Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic s...

## 6. Reflection-Satisfaction Tradeoff: Investigating Impact of Reflection on Student Engagement with AI-Generated Programming Hints

**Authors:** Heeryung Choi, Tung Phung, Mengyan Wu, Adish Singla, Christopher Brooks

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-04

**Summary:** Generative AI tools, such as AI-generated hints, are increasingly integrated into programming education to offer timely, personalized support. However, little is known about how to effectively leverage these hints while ensuring autonomous and meaningful learning. One promising approach involves pai...

## 7. ADAPT: Learning Task Mixtures for Budget-Constrained Instruction Tuning

**Authors:** Pritam Kadasi, Abhishek Upperwal, Mayank SIngh

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-04

**Summary:** We propose ADAPT, a meta-learning algorithm that \emph{learns} task sampling proportions under an explicit token budget for multi-task instruction tuning. Instead of fixing task weights by hand, \adapt{} maintains a continuous distribution over tasks and updates it via meta-gradients of a smooth wor...

## 8. SRPG: Semantically Reconstructed Privacy Guard for Zero-Trust Privacy in Educational Multi-Agent Systems

**Authors:** Shuang Guo, Zihui Li

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-03

**Summary:** Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with large language models (LLMs) enable personalized education but risk leaking minors personally identifiable information (PII) via unstructured dialogue. Existing privacy methods struggle to balance security and utility: role-based access control fails on unstructured te...

## 9. Curió-Edu 7B: Examining Data Selection Impacts in LLM Continued Pretraining

**Authors:** Thales Sales Almeida, Rodrigo Nogueira, Hélio Pedrini

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-14

**Summary:** Continued pretraining extends a language model's capabilities by further exposing it to additional data, often tailored to a specific linguistic or domain context. This strategy has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining when adapting general-purpose models to new settings. In this w...
