## 1. From Individual Prompts to Collective Intelligence: Mainstreaming Generative AI in the Classroom

**Authors:** Junaid Qadir, Muhammad Salman Khan

**Source:** arxiv • 2026-01-07

**Summary:** Engineering classrooms are increasingly experimenting with generative AI (GenAI), but most uses remain confined to individual prompting and isolated assistance. This narrow framing risks reinforcing equity gaps and only rewarding the already privileged or motivated students. We argue instead for a s...
