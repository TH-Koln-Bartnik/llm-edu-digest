## 45. Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Semantic and Token Entropy for LLM Reasoning

**Authors:** Hongye Cao, Zhixin Bai, Ziyue Peng, Boyan Wang, Tianpei Yang et al. (8 authors)

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-04

**Summary:** Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated superior performance in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, this accuracy-oriented learning paradigm often suffers from entropy collapse, which reduces policy exploration and limits reason...

## 47. Cyber Humanism in Education: Reclaiming Agency through AI and Learning Sciences

**Authors:** Giovanni Adorni

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-18

**Summary:** Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, c...
