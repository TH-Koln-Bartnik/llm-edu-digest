## 1. Teaching People LLM's Errors and Getting it Right

**Authors:** Nathan Stringham, Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori, Xinyuan Yan, Zhichao Xu, Bei Wang et al. (6 authors)

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-24

**Summary:** People use large language models (LLMs) when they should not. This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clusterin...

## 2. Large Language Models Approach Expert Pedagogical Quality in Math Tutoring but Differ in Instructional and Linguistic Profiles

**Authors:** Ramatu Oiza Abdulsalam, Segun Aroyehun

**Source:** arxiv • 2025-12-23

**Summary:** Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tuto...
